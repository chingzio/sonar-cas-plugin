# CAS server installation (local development)

## What you need

- Java JDK >= 8
- Maven
- docker
- docker-compose

Before you start, you need to pick a reachable host name. This host name is used for
- Authentication interaction between SonarQube and CAS
- SSL certificate check within CAS  

1. Generate a [keystore for your CAS host name](docker/README.md) 
   - alternatively go with the host name `cas.hitchhiker.com` for which a keystore is provided
1. Modify the static user list and attributes
   - currently only one user is configurable with static lists

```properties
cas.authn.attributeRepository.stub.attributes.mail=tricia.mcmillan@hitchhiker.com
cas.authn.attributeRepository.stub.attributes.displayName=Tricia McMillan
cas.authn.attributeRepository.stub.attributes.groups=admin

cas.authn.accept.users=admin::secretPassword
``` 

# Sonar CAS plugin installation (local development)

1. Map your local IP address to DNS names for proper Sonar â‡„ QubeCAS interaction
   - add a line to your `/etc/hosts` file like this:
   - `192.168.1.31 sonar.hitchhiker.com cas.hitchhiker.com`
   - check if the host names are reachable:
     - `ping cas.hitchhiker.com`
     - `ping sonar.hitchhiker.com`

1. Export your local IP address to environment variables for docker-compose:
   - either with a shell `export` or with `.env` file to be `source`'d
   - `SONAR_CAS_LOCAL_IP=192.168.1.31`
   - `SONAR_SONAR_LOCAL_IP=192.168.1.31`
1. Copy the plugin
1. Add the following properties to `conf/sonar.properties` then restart the server
1. build the CAS plugin and copy it into the SonarQube plugins directory

```
mvn clean install
cp target/sonar-cas-plugin-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar sonar-home/plugins
```

# Start SonarQube and CAS with docker-compose

This is easy as 1,2,3 because docker-compose is used. So make sure you have either the images in your docker cache or have a working internet connection.

Start both servers at once in the backup like this:

``` 
docker-compose up -d
```

For CAS plugin development you need to restart SonarQube in order to make the activate code changes. 

```
docker-compose restart sonar
```
 
You can view the respective log output with these commands:
```
docker-compose logs -f sonar
docker-compose logs -f cas
```

# Plugin configuration

### configure CAS plugin to handle authentication

`sonar.security.realm=cas`

### Allow Users to sign up

`sonar.authenticator.createUsers=true`

### force CAS authentication (no anonymous access allowed)

`sonar.cas.forceCasLogin=true`

### cas1, cas2 or saml11

`sonar.cas.protocol=cas2`

### Set the root URL of the CAS server

You should use HTTP/S where possible. Without ending slash.

`sonar.cas.casServerUrlPrefix = https://cas.hitchhiker.com:8443/cas`

### Location of the CAS server login form

`sonar.cas.casServerLoginUrl=https://cas.hitchhiker.com:8443/cas/login`

### Sonar server root URL

Without ending slash.

`sonar.cas.sonarServerUrl=http://localhost:9000`

### CAS server logout URL

mandatory CAS server logout URL. If set, sonar session will be deleted on CAS logout request. Also from the logout-button

`sonar.cas.casServerLogoutUrl=https://cas.hitchhiker.com:8443/cas/logout`

### Specifies whether gateway=true should be sent to the CAS server.

Default is false.

`sonar.cas.sendGateway=false`

### Path to CAS Session Store

As SonarQube does not provide a session (other than by issueing JWT tokens). When the user
logs out, the cookie containing the necessary JWT token is removed. WhatBut SonarQube *DOES
NOT* ensure that the JWT token (which is now no-longer valid) is ignored. Instead the JWT
token is still valid, enabling anyone to use SonarQube. 
  
The CAS plugin makes sure to blacklist existing tokens when the user logs out. In order to do
this the tokens must be stored persistently in order to outlive server or container restarts or even container recreations. Administrators may want to mount this as its own volume in order to scale with number of unexpired sessions.

The directory should live in SonarQube's working directory.

`sonar.cas.sessionStorePath = /opt/sonarqube/data/sonarcas/sessionstore`

## CAS Session Store clean up interval

The CAS session store stores JWT tokens which have an expiration date. These are kept for black- and whitelisting
JWTs from a user in order to prohibit attackers which gained access to a user's old JWT tokens.
 
Once these JWTs are expired they need to be removed from the store in a background ob. This property defines the
interval in seconds between each clean up run. Do not set the interval too short (this could lead to unnecessary
CPU load) or too long (this could lead to unnecessary filesystem load).
  
Default is 30 minutes, 0 disables the cleanup (this SHOULD NOT be done in a production environment)

`sonar.cas.sessionStore.cleanUpIntervalInSeconds = 1800`

### Configure CAS Attribute(s) 

Attributes holding the authorities (groups, roles, etc.) the user belongs to. Multiple
values should be separated with commas without further whitespace (e.g. 'groups,roles').

`sonar.cas.rolesAttributes=groups,roles`

### Attribute holding the user's full name.

Currently not supported related to Sonar limitations but is solved with CAS2 attributes.

`sonar.cas.fullNameAttribute=displayName`

### Attribute holding the user's email address.

`sonar.cas.eMailAttribute=mail`

### Configure clock drifting tolerance for SAML 1.1 tickets.

The tolerance in milliseconds for drifting clocks when validating SAML 1.1 tickets.

 Note that 10 seconds should be more than enough for most environments that have NTP time synchronization. Default is 1000 milliseconds.

`sonar.cas.saml11.toleranceMilliseconds=1000`

### Ignore certification validation errors.

**CAUTION! NEVER USE IN PROD! SECURITY RISK!**

This is only for development environments where a proper certificate chain is unfeasible. 

`sonar.cas.disableCertValidation=false`
